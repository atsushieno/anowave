It is my toy project for google wave.

It is one form of "ano-gakki" that can play together with other wave surfers.

For those who don't know ano-gakki, it is on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO7IOCVsCnk (it existed only virtually, until Japanese net geeks started to "create" such instruments).

The sound engine is based on SiON sound generator / MML compiler.

On google wave, it is "publicly" accessible (that means, only to those who can access to wave.google.com) at:
